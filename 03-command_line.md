### Q1.  Cheat Sheet of Commands  

Here's a list of items with which you should be familiar:  
* show current working directory path
* creating a directory
* deleting a directory
* creating a file using `touch` command
* deleting a file
* renaming a file
* listing hidden files
* copying a file from one directory to another

Make a cheat sheet for yourself: a list of at least **ten** commands and what they do.  (Use the 8 items above and add a couple of your own.)

### Q2.  List Files in Unix   

What do the following commands do:  
`ls`  
`ls -a`  
`ls -l`  
`ls -lh`  
`ls -lah`  
`ls -t`  
`ls -Glp`  

> > * `ls`  list directory
> > * `ls -a`  Include directory entries whose names begin with a dot (‘.’)
> > * `ls -l`  List in long format: the following information is displayed for each file: mode, number of links, owner, group, size in bytes, time of last modification (“mmm dd HH:MM”), and the pathname.
> > * `ls -lh`  List in long format, print sizes in human readable format (e.g., 1K 234M 2G)
> > * `ls -lah`  The `a` include directories whose names begin with a '.'
> > * `ls -t`  Sort by time modified
> > * `ls -Glp` `-G` Don't print group names; `l` long format; `p` include a slash in directory path names, useful for visually separating directories from files

### Q3.  More List Files in Unix  

Explore these other [ls options](http://www.techonthenet.com/unix/basic/ls.php) and pick 5 of your favorites:

> > * `ls -1` One entry per line
> > * `ls -S` Sort by size, largest file first
> > * `ls - x` Multi-column output sorted across the page rather than down the page (This is good to know, but I actually dislike this readout. It's much less legible.
> > * `ls -r` reverse reverse
> > * `ls -F` flags filenames
